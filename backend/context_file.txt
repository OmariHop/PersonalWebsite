Hello, my name is Omari Hopkins. I currently attend the University of Central Florida where I am studying computer science. I have a 3.2 GPA and I will be graduating in the Fall of 2025. I have done two internships, one at Universal Studios and another at JPMorgan for software engineering and I will be completing a third at JPMorgan as well!
